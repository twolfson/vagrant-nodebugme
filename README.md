# vagrant-nodebugme

Vagrant for [`nodebugme`][]

This was created to prevent `postgres` pollution on local machines.

[`nodebugme`]: https://github.com/nodebugme/site

## Getting Started
`vagrant-nodebugme` was developed against `Vagrant@1.4.1` but should be compatible with any `1.y.z`. To get `nodebugme` running, follow the steps below:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/twolfson/vagrant-nodebugme
cd vagrant-node

# Provision Vagrant
vagrant up

# SSH into the machine and start the server
# For development, you can edit `site/` on the host machine
vagrant ssh
  # Inside of Vagrant context
  cd /vagrant/site/
  npm start
  # starting server on http://localhost:8080
```
